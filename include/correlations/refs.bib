  abstract 	= {Viscosity is one of the most important governing parameters of the fluid flow, either in the porous media or in pipelines. So it is of great importance to use an accurate correlation to calculate the oil viscosity at various operating conditions. Whenever laboratory data are obtained, efforts are made to find a best-fit correlation, because demand for mathematical equation of fluid flow for reservoir simulation, pressure traverse calculation and so on compel the person to use empirical and semi-empirical correlations to find viscosity at various points of the flow path (along which T, P, Rs and other parameters may vary). In the literature, several empirical correlations have been proposed for predicting undersaturated oil viscosity. Here, based on Iranian
oil reservoirs data; new correlation has been developed for prediction of undersaturated oil viscosity. Validity and accuracy of this correlation has been confirmed by comparing the obtained results of this correlation and other ones with experimental data for Iranian oil samples. Checking the results of this correlation shows that the obtained results of Iranian oil viscosities in this work are in agreement with experimental data compared with other correlations.},

Correlation charts, for the purpose of predicting crude oil viscosity andsolubility behavior at oil field temperatures and pressures, were constructedfrom an analysis and correlation of 1332 viscosity and solubility observationsfrom 953 crude oil samples taken from 747 oil fields. Of these fields, 501 arein the United States, including 75 in California. Of the 1332 observations,12I5 were viscosity values, including 786 of gas-free crude oil, 351 of oilsaturated with gas, and 78 undersaturated with gas at pressures above thebubble point.
Results show that crude oil viscosity at various reservoir conditions can bepredicted with average deviations varying from 24.2 per cent for gas-free crudeoil to as little as 2.7 per cent for under saturated crude oil \"above thebubble point.\" The solubility of crude oil may be predicted from oilgravity and saturation pressure with an average deviation of 22.0 per cent fromobserved values. In conclusion, it is shown that the viscosity of a gas andgas-saturated crude oil may be predicted within the accuracy of most reservoircomputations.}

The reliability has been evaluated against a set of about 65 heavy and extra-heavy oil samples. About 1200 measured data points have been collected and investigated. All measured data points are reported in the paper. For all the correlations, the following statistical parameters have been calculated: a) relative deviation between estimated and experimental values, b) average absolute percent error, c) standard deviation.

Oil samples have been divided in two different API gravity classes: extra-heavy oils for APl<=10, heavy oils for 10<API<=22.3. The best correlations for each class of API gravity have been evaluated for each oil-property.

The functional forms of the correlations that gave the best results for each oil property have been used for finding a better correlation with errors reduced, on average, by 10\%. In particular, for extra-heavy oils, since no correlations are available in literature (except for viscosity), a special investigation has been performed and new equations are proposed.}

- Bubblepoint pressure.
- Solution gas/oil ratio (GOR) at bubblepoint pressure.
- Oil formation volume factor (FVF) at bubblepoint pressure.
- Undersaturated isothermal oil compressibility.
- Dead-oil viscosity.
- Saturated-oil viscosity.
- Undersaturated-oil viscosity.

For the development of correlations, we have covered a wide range of data. More than 100 PVT reports from the GOM have been used in the development of correlations. Two of the published correlations (those of Standing and Petrosky and Farshad) were tested with our GOM data set. Proposed correlations of this study predicted the PVT properties of GOM oils better than the correlations published in the literature, even when the coefficients of the published correlations are tuned. Using the correlations of this study, we have written a simple program that can generate PVT data sets for use in reservoir simulation. Laboratory-measured differential-liberation data for two different oil samples were also compared against our empirically generated differential-liberation data.}

A replot of the original data in the form compressibility versus pseudo-reduced density, with pseudo-reduced temperature as a parameter reveals irregularities at various points, with large departures occurring in portions of the 1.05, 1.10 and 1.15 pseudo-reduced isotherms. 

In this work the above mentioned isotherms have been smoothed and the resulting correlation fitted by means of an eight coefficient Benedict-Webb-Rubin type equation. This compact algebraic expression is capable of regenerating the Z, Pr, Tr surface within a standard error of 0.00445 in Z.}

  abstract 	= {Compressibility factor of natural gases is necessary in many petroleum engineering calculations. Some of these calculations are: evaluation of newly discovered formation, pressure drop from flow of gas through pipe, pressure gradient in gas wells, gas metering, gas compression, and processing. Typically, the gas compressibility factor is measured by laboratory experiments. These experiments are expensive and time consuming. Occasionally, experimental data became unavailable and the gas compressibility factor is estimated from correlations using gas composition or gas gravity.

This paper presents new methods for calculating the gas compressibility factors for the gas condensates at any temperature and pressure. The method is based on compositional analysis of 1200 compositions of gas condensates collected worldwide. When gas composition is known, this study presents a simple mixing rule to calculate the pseudo-critical properties of the gas condensate. The new mixing rule accounts for the presence of the heptane plus fraction. In case gas composition is unavailable, the study presents new gas gravity correlation to estimate pseudo-critical properties of the gas condensate. The study also presents evaluation of eight methods to characterized the plus fraction, three widely used mixing rules, and six methods to calculate the gas compressibility factor. Thus, this study presents evaluation of one-hundred forty-four possible methods of calculating the gas compressibility factor for gas condensates. Accuracy of the new mixing rule and the gas gravity correlation has been compared to other published methods. The comparison indicates that the proposed methods are consistent and provide accurate results.}

  abstract 	= {This paper presents the initial stage of an effort aimed at developing a new correlation to estimate pseudo critical properties for sour gas when the exact composition is not known. Several mixing rules and gas gravity correlations available in the literature are first evaluated and compared. The evaluation is performed on a large database consisting of more than 2000 samples of sour gas compositions collected worldwide. Several evaluation criteria are used including the average absolute deviation (AAD), the standard deviation (SD), the coefficient of correlation, R, and cross plots and error histograms. The mixing rules include: Kay's mixing rule combined with Wichert-Aziz correlation for the presence of non-hydrocarbons, SSBV mixing rule with Wichert and Aziz, Corredor et al. mixing rule, and Piper et al. mixing rule. These methods, in one form or another, use information on gas composition. Three different other methods that are based on gas gravity alone were also analyzed. These are: Standing, Sutton, and Elsharkawy et al. gas gravity correlations. While the methods based on knowledge of composition showed reasonable accuracy, those based on gas gravity alone showed weak accuracy with low correlation coefficients. A new gas gravity correlation that is based on the fraction of non-hydrocarbons present in the sour gas was proposed. Preliminary results indicate that a good improvement over past gravity correlations was achieved. The compositional correlations, still show, however, better accuracy. Research is still going on to come up with more accurate correlations that are based on only readily available descriptors.}

  abstract	= {The influence of fluid viscosity on flow is especially important inpetroleum reservoirs. Gas is now a highly desirable hydrocarbon resource. Anaccurate prediction of transport properties of natural gases is very importantin the design and operation of fluid transportation, production, andprocessing. Viscosity is one of these properties. Many viscosity correlationsare available but each has limitations in the range of applicability. Only theCarr et al. charts include the correction for gas impurities andreservoir pressure and temperature. Using Carr et al. charts you have tofollow five steps to find the natural gas viscosity at any condition. As aresults, some errors and inaccurated will occur and more time will be consumed.Standing proposed a convenient mathematical expressing for calculation theviscosity of the natural gas at atmospheric pressure and reservoir temperature,µ1. Standing also presented equations for describing the effects of impuritieson µ1. Dempsey expressed the viscosity ratio (the viscosity at high pressure tothe viscosity at 1 atm), by using reduced pressure and temperature.

Using the Standing equation and the slightly revised Dempsey equation, thenatural gas viscosity at high pressure can be found by one step only. Itincludes all corrections for gas impurities. Its also includes any condition atthe reservoir pressure and temperature.}

  abstract	= {An accurate description of physical properties for crude oils is necessary for solving many of reservoir engineering and surface production operational problems. Ideally, crude oil properties are determined experimentally in the laboratory on actual fluid samples taken from the field under study. However, in the absence of experimentally measured crude oil properties, especially during the prospecting phase, or when only invalid samples are available, one can resort to empirically derived PVT correlations. During the last five decades, several correlations have been developed to estimate the crude oil properties. However, these correlations may be useful only in regional geological provinces and may not provide satisfactory results when applied to crude oils from other regions. The aim of this work is to derive and test new correlations to predict the fluid properties for Egyptian crudes including bubble point pressure, solution gas-oil-ratio, oil formation volume factor, oil compressibility, oil density, and oil viscosity. These correlations have been developed from the experimental PVT data of 324 fluid samples covering a wide range of crude oils ranging from heavy to volatile oils. The fluid samples have been taken from 176 wells located in 75 fields operated by 16 companies. This data represents 15 productive zones of 123 reservoirs distributed along three different regions of Egypt, including the Gulf of Suez, Western Desert, and Sinai. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the experimentally determined flash liberation gas-oil-ratio, which corresponds to the producing gas-oil-ratio, is the most correlative parameter with the bubble point pressure. Therefore the separator gas-oil ratio was used in this study as the key parameter for predicting the oil properties. The procedure for predicting the fluid properties using the new correlations is simple and straightforward. By starting with the separator gas-oil-ratio then going through good correlations between different pairs of fluid properties, one can obtain a complete set of PVT data for oil properties either at or above or below the bubble point pressure. Finally, this study compares the predicted properties from the new correlations and the commonly used empirical correlations by applying them to the experimental data base available for Egyptian crude oils.}

The interfacial-tension data were obtained by the pendent drop method. The density data used for pendent drop method. The density data used for the pendent drop calculations were based on visual cell pressure volume measurements of the mutually saturated phases. Seven systems covering the methane-decane composition range from 100 percent decane to 100 percent methane were studied at three temperatures and 11 pressure intervals in the single-phase, hydrocarbon region.

A minimum in the interfacial-tension vs methane-decane composition curve was observed. The minimum occurred at about the same composition in each isotherm, namely, with a mixture containing nearly equal weights of methane and decane. Both temperature and pressure affected the interfacial tension. For some compositions at constant pressure the interfacial tension increased with increased temperature.}

  abstract	= {The compressibility factor (z-factor) of gases is a thermodynamic property used to account for the deviation of real gas behavior from that of an ideal gas. Correlations based on the equation of state are often implicit, because they require iteration and are computationally expensive. A number of explicit correlations have been derived to enhance simplicity; however, no single explicit correlation has been developed for the full range of pseudo-reduced temperatures (1.05≤Tpr≤3) and pseudo-reduced pressures (0.2≤Ppr≤15), which represents a significant research gap. This work presents a new z-factor correlation that can be expressed in linear form. On the basis of Hall and Yarborough’s implicit correlation, we developed the new correlation from 5346 experimental data points extracted from 5940 data points published in the SPE natural gas reservoir engineering textbook and created a linear z-factor chart for a full range of pseudo-reduced temperatures (1.15≤Tpr≤3) and pseudo-reduced pressures (0.2≤Ppr≤15).}

  abstract	= {Determining extra heavy oil viscosity is a challenge for engineers, when there is not available a PVT test,
therefore, this study offers an option for estimating extra heavy oil PVT properties. Using 48 PVT tests from saturated
oil reservoirs located in Bare and Arecuna fields, from Ayacucho Area of the Faja Petrolífera del Orinoco, it was
possible to obtain multiple regression models to estimate bubble pressure, solution gas – oil ratio, oil formation volume
factor and oil viscosity, from easily measured variables, such as reservoir pressure and temperature, API oil gravity and
separator gas specific gravity.

Once the data was validated, the models were generated by mean of linear and non-linear regression, by using statistical
methodology for this purpose. These models were compared with others equations developed for heavy oil, such as,
TOTAL, De Gettho et al., E. Millan, A. Granado, J. Castillo & Perez-Henny-Lago, proving that the new regression models
obtained in this study showed lower standard deviation (SD), lower average error (EM), and higher determination coefficient (R^2). 
The new regression models have been used in several studies performed for:

1) Bare and Arecuna field’s reservoir characterization.
2) Estimating oil viscosity and others saturated fluid properties used in dynamic simulation and modeling.
3) Determination of oil formation volume factor and oil viscosity, for estimating initial potential in horizontal wells.
4) Improving the oil reserves estimation in the Faja Petrolífera del Orinoco.

When there is not lab PVT analysis of samples of crude oils, these regression models have been used successfully,
obtaining synthetic PVT analysis of extra heavy oil reservoir from the Faja Petrolífera del Orinoco.}

  abstract	= {The role of reservoir fluid viscosity for reservoir evaluation in performance calculations, planning thermal methods of enhanced oil recovery, evaluation of hydrocarbon reserves and designing production equipment and pipelines makes its accurate determination necessary. Reservoir oil viscosity is usually measured isothermally at reservoir temperature. However, at temperature other than reservoir temperature these data are estimated by empirical correlations. High dependency of oil viscosity on fluid nature and fluid source causes the unique application of these correlations to special cases from which they have been derived.

Here, based on Iranian oil reservoirs data; new correlations have been developed for prediction of dead, saturated and under-saturated oil viscosities. These correlations have been derived using so many oil viscosity data. Validity and accuracy of these correlations have been confirmed by comparing the obtained results of these correlations and other ones with experimental data for so many Iranian oil samples. In contrast to other correlations which need so many specific parameters for oil viscosity prediction, this type of correlations need only some field data which always are available. Checking the results of these correlations shows that the obtained results of Iranian oil viscosities in this work are in agreement with experimental data compared with other correlations.}

  abstract	= {Conventional calculation of total system isothermal compressibility for a system containing a free gas phase involves, among other things, evaluation of the change of oil and gas formation volume factors and the gas in solution with pressure. Preferably, this information should be obtained from laboratory measurements made with particular oils and gases. Often, experimental measurements are not available. In this case, it is necessary to obtain pressure- volume- temperature relationships from general correlations such as those of Standing for California oils. In order to speed estimates of compressibility, generalized plots have been prepared of the change of both oil formation volume factors and gas in solution, with pressure from Standing's correlations. A generalized plot for estimating the change in the two-phase (oil and gas) formation volume factor with pressure is also presented. Usually, the effect of gas dissolved in reservoir water upon the total system compressibility is neglected for gas saturated systems, due to the low solubility of gas in water. Results of this study indicate that the increase in total system compressibility caused by solution of gas in water is often as large as the compressibility of water, and can be magnitudes larger for low pressure systems. Generalized results for estimating the change of gas in solution in water with pressure are presented in tabular and graphical form.}

  abstract 	= {This paper examines the effect of high concentrations of the heptanes-plus fraction in natural gases on the calculation of gas compressibility (Z) factors. Laboratory measured gas compositions and Z factors are used to evaluate the accuracy of the Standing-Katz chart. It was determined that the chart itself provides satisfactory accuracy; however, Kay's molar average combination rules or comparable gravity relationships for calculating pseudo-critical pressure and temperature result in unsatisfactory Z factors for high molecular weight reservoir gases. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, new pseudo-critical property - gas gravity relationships are developed, and second, alternate methods for calculating pseudo-critical properties from composition are established. properties from composition are established. By utilizing either of these methods to calculate pseudo-critical pressure and temperature, pseudo-critical pressure and temperature, the overall accuracy of Z factors from the Standing-Katz chart is increased almost three-fold. Introduction High molecular weight hydrocarbon gases normally encountered in the petroleum industry can be grouped into two general categories. Natural gases in the first category contain relatively high concentrations of ethane and propane typically as the result of a low pressure flash with crude oil, while gases in the pressure flash with crude oil, while gases in the second category are gas-condensates and derive their high molecular weight from the quantity of heptanes-plus present. This paper is concerned with latter category present. This paper is concerned with latter category of gases. The calculation of natural gas volume, density, or viscosity at elevated pressures and temperatures requires values of Z factor. These quantities are necessary for the evaluation of gas reserves, the resulting pressure drop from flow through pipe, static pressure gradients in gas wells, and reservoir pressure gradients in gas wells, and reservoir performance. Ideally, gas PVT properties are performance. Ideally, gas PVT properties are determined from laboratory studies designed to duplicate conditions of interest. However, quite often experimental data is unavailable, or PVT properties must be evaluated at conditions different properties must be evaluated at conditions different from those examined by the laboratory studies. In these cases, PVT properties must be determined from correlations. Probably the most widely accepted correlation for natural gas mixtures is the Standing-Katz (SK) Z factor chart. The SK chart was developed using data for binary mixtures of methane with propane, ethane, butane, and natural gases having a wide range of composition. None of the gas mixtures had molecular weights in excess of 40. The SK chart is actually a modification and extension of a generalized, Z factor chart developed by Brown and Holcomb (BH) and is identical to the BH chart at reduced pressures less than 4. Above this value, the BH chart was found to be consistently inaccurate; therefore, Standing and Katz used data from 16 natural gas mixtures, along with methane Z factors as a guide, to extend the chart to reduced pressures of 15. Since the SK chart appeared in the literature in 1941, equations of state have been developed which effectively reproduce and extend the chart as shown by the Dranchuk and Abou-Kassem method in Figs. 1A and 1B. This chart correlates Z factor as a function of pseudo-reduced pressure and temperature: pressure and temperature: Z = f(Ppr, Tpr)...............................(1) where the pseudo-reduced pressure and temperature are defined relative to pseudo-critical pressure and temperature. Ppr = P/Ppc...................................(2) Tpr = T/Tpc...................................(3)}

  abstract	= {Virtually all of the published correlations for solution gasoil ratios for pressures at and below bubble-point pressures suffer from two major deficiencies. First, calculated values of solution gas-oil ratios do not match the concave up - point of inflection - concave down shapes as pressure declines below the bubble-point that are evident in experimental data, especially at high initial gas-oil ratios. Second, bubble-point pressure must be estimated using the same correlations; there is no convenient way to impose a known bubble-point pressure - such as one derived from reservoir pressure data. We propose a correlation where the equations are formulated to solve both of these problems.

Published correlations for oil formation volume factors for pressures at and below bubble-point pressures suffer the same two deficiencies plus a third problem: the material balance connection between oil formation volume factors, solution gas-oil ratios, and reservoir oil densities is not honored. We propose an oil formation volume factor calculation which is based on the solution gas-oil ratio correlation described above so that the first two deficiencies are alleviated. Further, the proposed correlation connects these fluids properties in material balance format.

In addition to solving the deficiencies discussed above, the proposed correlations fit our data base of 2097 laboratory measured values much more closely than other published correlations.

Also, we propose a modification of an existing bubble-point pressure correlation which can be used in the event that a field-data derived bubble-point pressure is not available. This correlation fits our data base of 728 laboratories measured bubble-point pressures more closely than other published correlations.

All three of the proposed correlations require the usual field data; solution gas-oil ratio at the bubble-point, reservoir temperature, separator gas specific gravity, and stock tank oil gravity.}

  abstract	= {This work studies the effect of heptanes-plus (C7+) characterization on equation-of-state (EOS) predictions. Both the Peng-Robinson EOS (PREOS) and a modified Redlich-Kwong EOS are used. Several characterization schemes found in the literature are used in the study. Six reservoir fluids with extended C7+ analysis have been chosen, representing a broad range of compositions and PVT data.

First, the study deals with methods for estimating specific gravities and boiling points of petroleum fractions, two properties usually required by critical property correlations. EOS predictions are made by using critical properties based on specific gravities and boiling points measured experimentally and estimated with correlations.

Next, a review of critical-property correlations is given, including a review of commonly used correlations. Four correlations are chosen to study the effect of critical properties on EOS predictions. Results indicate that relatively small differences in critical properties and acentric factor can result in significant differences in EOS predictions.

Finally, a study is made of the effect that adjustments in C7+ critical properties have on EOS predictions; adjustments of EOS constants (Oa and Ob) and binary interaction coefficients also are studied. The influence of individual and combined adjustments to C7+ properties are illustrated graphically. They provide qualitative guidelines that can be used when matching experimental PVT data with an EOS.}
