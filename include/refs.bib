  abstract = {Viscosity is one of the most important governing parameters of the fluid flow, either in the porous media or in pipelines. So it is of great importance to use an accurate correlation to calculate the oil viscosity at various operating conditions. Whenever laboratory data are obtained, efforts are made to find a best-fit correlation, because demand for mathematical equation of fluid flow for reservoir simulation, pressure traverse calculation and so on compel the person to use empirical and semi-empirical correlations to find viscosity at various points of the flow path (along which T, P, Rs and other parameters may vary). In the literature, several empirical correlations have been proposed for predicting undersaturated oil viscosity. Here, based on Iranian
oil reservoirs data; new correlation has been developed for prediction of undersaturated oil viscosity. Validity and accuracy of this correlation has been confirmed by comparing the obtained results of this correlation and other ones with experimental data for Iranian oil samples. Checking the results of this correlation shows that the obtained results of Iranian oil viscosities in this work are in agreement with experimental data compared with other correlations.},

  abstract 	= {This paper evaluates published correlations and neural network models for bubble point pressure and oil formation
volume factor for accuracy and flexibility to represent hydrocarbon mixtures from different geographical locations worldwide. The study presents a new correlation for bubble point pressure based on global data with improvement in performance over published correlations. It also presents new neural network models and compares their performance to numerical correlations.

The evaluation examines the performance of correlations with original published coefficients and with coefficients calculated based on global data, data from a specific geographical locations, and data for a limited oil gravity range. The evaluation of each coefficient class includes geographical and oil gravity grouping analysis. The results show that the classification of correlation models as most accurate for a specific geographical area is invalid to be used for these two fluid properties. Statistical and trend performance analysis shows that some of the correlations are violating the physical behavior of hydrocarbon fluid properties. Published neural network models are missing major model parameters to reproduce. New developed models performed better, but suffer
from stability and trend problems.}

  abstract 	= {Compressibility factor of natural gases is necessary in many petroleumengineering calculations. Some of these calculations are: evaluation of newlydiscovered formation, pressure drop from flow of gas through pipe, pressuregradient in gas wells, gas metering, gas compression, and processing.Typically, the gas compressibility factor is measured by laboratoryexperiments. These experiments are expensive and time consuming. Occasionally,experimental data became unavailable and the gas compressibility factor isestimated from correlations using gas composition or gas gravity.

This paper presents new methods for calculating the gas compressibilityfactors for the gas condensates at any temperature and pressure. The method isbased on compositional analysis of 1200 compositions of gas condensatescollected worldwide. When gas composition is known, this study presents asimple mixing rule to calculate the pseudo-critical properties of the gascondensate. The new mixing rule accounts for the presence of the heptane plusfraction. In case gas composition is unavailable, the study presents new gasgravity correlation to estimate pseudo-critical properties of the gascondensate. The study also presents evaluation of eight methods tocharacterized the plus fraction, three widely used mixing rules, and sixmethods to calculate the gas compressibility factor. Thus, this study presentsevaluation of one-hundred forty-four possible methods of calculating the gascompressibility factor for gas condensates. Accuracy of the new mixing rule andthe gas gravity correlation has been compared to other published methods. Thecomparison indicates that the proposed methods are consistent and provideaccurate results.}

  abstract 	= {This paper presents the initial stage of an effort aimed at developing a new correlation to estimate pseudo critical properties for sour gas when the exact composition is not known. Several mixing rules and gas gravity correlations available in the literature are first evaluated and compared. The evaluation is performed on a large database consisting of more than 2000 samples of sour gas compositions collected worldwide. Several evaluation criteria are used including the average absolute deviation (AAD), the standard deviation (SD), the coefficient of correlation, R, and cross plots and error histograms. The mixing rules include: Kay's mixing rule combined with Wichert-Aziz correlation for the presence of non-hydrocarbons, SSBV mixing rule with Wichert and Aziz, Corredor et al. mixing rule, and Piper et al. mixing rule. These methods, in one form or another, use information on gas composition. Three different other methods that are based on gas gravity alone were also analyzed. These are: Standing, Sutton, and Elsharkawy et al. gas gravity correlations. While the methods based on knowledge of composition showed reasonable accuracy, those based on gas gravity alone showed weak accuracy with low correlation coefficients. A new gas gravity correlation that is based on the fraction of non-hydrocarbons present in the sour gas was proposed. Preliminary results indicate that a good improvement over past gravity correlations was achieved. The compositional correlations, still show, however, better accuracy. Research is still going on to come up with more accurate correlations that are based on only readily available descriptors.}

  abstract 	= {This paper examines the effect of high concentrations of the heptanes-plus fraction in natural gases on the calculation of gas compressibility (Z) factors. Laboratory measured gas compositions and Z factors are used to evaluate the accuracy of the Standing-Katz chart. It was determined that the chart itself provides satisfactory accuracy; however, Kay's molar average combination rules or comparable gravity relationships for calculating pseudo-critical pressure and temperature result in unsatisfactory Z factors for high molecular weight reservoir gases. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, new pseudo-critical property - gas gravity relationships are developed, and second, alternate methods for calculating pseudo-critical properties from composition are established. properties from composition are established. By utilizing either of these methods to calculate pseudo-critical pressure and temperature, pseudo-critical pressure and temperature, the overall accuracy of Z factors from the Standing-Katz chart is increased almost three-fold. Introduction High molecular weight hydrocarbon gases normally encountered in the petroleum industry can be grouped into two general categories. Natural gases in the first category contain relatively high concentrations of ethane and propane typically as the result of a low pressure flash with crude oil, while gases in the pressure flash with crude oil, while gases in the second category are gas-condensates and derive their high molecular weight from the quantity of heptanes-plus present. This paper is concerned with latter category present. This paper is concerned with latter category of gases. The calculation of natural gas volume, density, or viscosity at elevated pressures and temperatures requires values of Z factor. These quantities are necessary for the evaluation of gas reserves, the resulting pressure drop from flow through pipe, static pressure gradients in gas wells, and reservoir pressure gradients in gas wells, and reservoir performance. Ideally, gas PVT properties are performance. Ideally, gas PVT properties are determined from laboratory studies designed to duplicate conditions of interest. However, quite often experimental data is unavailable, or PVT properties must be evaluated at conditions different properties must be evaluated at conditions different from those examined by the laboratory studies. In these cases, PVT properties must be determined from correlations. Probably the most widely accepted correlation for natural gas mixtures is the Standing-Katz (SK) Z factor chart. The SK chart was developed using data for binary mixtures of methane with propane, ethane, butane, and natural gases having a wide range of composition. None of the gas mixtures had molecular weights in excess of 40. The SK chart is actually a modification and extension of a generalized, Z factor chart developed by Brown and Holcomb (BH) and is identical to the BH chart at reduced pressures less than 4. Above this value, the BH chart was found to be consistently inaccurate; therefore, Standing and Katz used data from 16 natural gas mixtures, along with methane Z factors as a guide, to extend the chart to reduced pressures of 15. Since the SK chart appeared in the literature in 1941, equations of state have been developed which effectively reproduce and extend the chart as shown by the Dranchuk and Abou-Kassem method in Figs. 1A and 1B. This chart correlates Z factor as a function of pseudo-reduced pressure and temperature: pressure and temperature: Z = f(Ppr, Tpr)...............................(1) where the pseudo-reduced pressure and temperature are defined relative to pseudo-critical pressure and temperature. Ppr = P/Ppc...................................(2) Tpr = T/Tpc...................................(3)}
