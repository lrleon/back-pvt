  abstract 	= {Viscosity is one of the most important governing parameters of the fluid flow, either in the porous media or in pipelines. So it is of great importance to use an accurate correlation to calculate the oil viscosity at various operating conditions. Whenever laboratory data are obtained, efforts are made to find a best-fit correlation, because demand for mathematical equation of fluid flow for reservoir simulation, pressure traverse calculation and so on compel the person to use empirical and semi-empirical correlations to find viscosity at various points of the flow path (along which T, P, Rs and other parameters may vary). In the literature, several empirical correlations have been proposed for predicting undersaturated oil viscosity. Here, based on Iranian
oil reservoirs data; new correlation has been developed for prediction of undersaturated oil viscosity. Validity and accuracy of this correlation has been confirmed by comparing the obtained results of this correlation and other ones with experimental data for Iranian oil samples. Checking the results of this correlation shows that the obtained results of Iranian oil viscosities in this work are in agreement with experimental data compared with other correlations.},

volume factor for accuracy and flexibility to represent hydrocarbon mixtures from different geographical locations worldwide. The study presents a new correlation for bubble point pressure based on global data with improvement in performance over published correlations. It also presents new neural network models and compares their performance to numerical correlations.

The evaluation examines the performance of correlations with original published coefficients and with coefficients calculated based on global data, data from a specific geographical locations, and data for a limited oil gravity range. The evaluation of each coefficient class includes geographical and oil gravity grouping analysis. The results show that the classification of correlation models as most accurate for a specific geographical area is invalid to be used for these two fluid properties. Statistical and trend performance analysis shows that some of the correlations are violating the physical behavior of hydrocarbon fluid properties. Published neural network models are missing major model parameters to reproduce. New developed models performed better, but suffer
from stability and trend problems.}

Correlation charts, for the purpose of predicting crude oil viscosity andsolubility behavior at oil field temperatures and pressures, were constructedfrom an analysis and correlation of 1332 viscosity and solubility observationsfrom 953 crude oil samples taken from 747 oil fields. Of these fields, 501 arein the United States, including 75 in California. Of the 1332 observations,12I5 were viscosity values, including 786 of gas-free crude oil, 351 of oilsaturated with gas, and 78 undersaturated with gas at pressures above thebubble point.
Results show that crude oil viscosity at various reservoir conditions can bepredicted with average deviations varying from 24.2 per cent for gas-free crudeoil to as little as 2.7 per cent for under saturated crude oil \"above thebubble point.\" The solubility of crude oil may be predicted from oilgravity and saturation pressure with an average deviation of 22.0 per cent fromobserved values. In conclusion, it is shown that the viscosity of a gas andgas-saturated crude oil may be predicted within the accuracy of most reservoircomputations.}

The reliability has been evaluated against a set of about 65 heavy and extra-heavy oil samples. About 1200 measured data points have been collected and investigated. All measured data points are reported in the paper. For all the correlations, the following statistical parameters have been calculated: a) relative deviation between estimated and experimental values, b) average absolute percent error, c) standard deviation.

Oil samples have been divided in two different API gravity classes: extra-heavy oils for APl<=10, heavy oils for 10<API<=22.3. The best correlations for each class of API gravity have been evaluated for each oil-property.

The functional forms of the correlations that gave the best results for each oil property have been used for finding a better correlation with errors reduced, on average, by 10\%. In particular, for extra-heavy oils, since no correlations are available in literature (except for viscosity), a special investigation has been performed and new equations are proposed.}

- Bubblepoint pressure.
- Solution gas/oil ratio (GOR) at bubblepoint pressure.
- Oil formation volume factor (FVF) at bubblepoint pressure.
- Undersaturated isothermal oil compressibility.
- Dead-oil viscosity.
- Saturated-oil viscosity.
- Undersaturated-oil viscosity.

For the development of correlations, we have covered a wide range of data. More than 100 PVT reports from the GOM have been used in the development of correlations. Two of the published correlations (those of Standing and Petrosky and Farshad) were tested with our GOM data set. Proposed correlations of this study predicted the PVT properties of GOM oils better than the correlations published in the literature, even when the coefficients of the published correlations are tuned. Using the correlations of this study, we have written a simple program that can generate PVT data sets for use in reservoir simulation. Laboratory-measured differential-liberation data for two different oil samples were also compared against our empirically generated differential-liberation data.}

  abstract 	= {Compressibility factor of natural gases is necessary in many petroleum engineering calculations. Some of these calculations are: evaluation of newly discovered formation, pressure drop from flow of gas through pipe, pressure gradient in gas wells, gas metering, gas compression, and processing. Typically, the gas compressibility factor is measured by laboratory experiments. These experiments are expensive and time consuming. Occasionally, experimental data became unavailable and the gas compressibility factor is estimated from correlations using gas composition or gas gravity.

This paper presents new methods for calculating the gas compressibility factors for the gas condensates at any temperature and pressure. The method is based on compositional analysis of 1200 compositions of gas condensates collected worldwide. When gas composition is known, this study presents a simple mixing rule to calculate the pseudo-critical properties of the gas condensate. The new mixing rule accounts for the presence of the heptane plus fraction. In case gas composition is unavailable, the study presents new gas gravity correlation to estimate pseudo-critical properties of the gas condensate. The study also presents evaluation of eight methods to characterized the plus fraction, three widely used mixing rules, and six methods to calculate the gas compressibility factor. Thus, this study presents evaluation of one-hundred forty-four possible methods of calculating the gas compressibility factor for gas condensates. Accuracy of the new mixing rule and the gas gravity correlation has been compared to other published methods. The comparison indicates that the proposed methods are consistent and provide accurate results.}

The evaluation is performed on a large database consisting of more than 2000 samples of sour gas compositions collected worldwide. Several evaluation criteria are used including the average absolute deviation (AAD), the standard deviation (SD), the coefficient of correlation, R, and cross plots and error histograms. The mixing rules include: Kay's mixing rule combined with Wichert-Aziz correlation for the presence of non-hydrocarbons, SSBV mixing rule with Wichert and Aziz, Corredor et al. mixing rule, and Piper et al. mixing rule. These methods, in one form or another, use information on gas composition. Three different other methods that are based on gas gravity alone were also analyzed. These are: Standing, Sutton, and Elsharkawy et al. gas gravity correlations. While the methods based on knowledge of composition showed reasonable accuracy, those based on gas gravity alone showed weak accuracy with low correlation coefficients. A new gas gravity correlation that is based on the fraction of non-hydrocarbons present in the sour gas was proposed. Preliminary results indicate that a good improvement over past gravity correlations was achieved. The compositional correlations, still show, however, better accuracy. Research is still going on to come up with more accurate correlations that are based on only readily available descriptors.}

  abstract	= {An accurate description of physical properties for crude oils is necessary for solving many of reservoir engineering and surface production operational problems. Ideally, crude oil properties are determined experimentally in the laboratory on actual fluid samples taken from the field under study. However, in the absence of experimentally measured crude oil properties, especially during the prospecting phase, or when only invalid samples are available, one can resort to empirically derived PVT correlations. During the last five decades, several correlations have been developed to estimate the crude oil properties. However, these correlations may be useful only in regional geological provinces and may not provide satisfactory results when applied to crude oils from other regions. The aim of this work is to derive and test new correlations to predict the fluid properties for Egyptian crudes including bubble point pressure, solution gas-oil-ratio, oil formation volume factor, oil compressibility, oil density, and oil viscosity. These correlations have been developed from the experimental PVT data of 324 fluid samples covering a wide range of crude oils ranging from heavy to volatile oils. The fluid samples have been taken from 176 wells located in 75 fields operated by 16 companies. This data represents 15 productive zones of 123 reservoirs distributed along three different regions of Egypt, including the Gulf of Suez, Western Desert, and Sinai. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the experimentally determined flash liberation gas-oil-ratio, which corresponds to the producing gas-oil-ratio, is the most correlative parameter with the bubble point pressure. Therefore the separator gas-oil ratio was used in this study as the key parameter for predicting the oil properties. The procedure for predicting the fluid properties using the new correlations is simple and straightforward. By starting with the separator gas-oil-ratio then going through good correlations between different pairs of fluid properties, one can obtain a complete set of PVT data for oil properties either at or above or below the bubble point pressure. Finally, this study compares the predicted properties from the new correlations and the commonly used empirical correlations by applying them to the experimental data base available for Egyptian crude oils.}

  abstract 	= {This paper examines the effect of high concentrations of the heptanes-plus fraction in natural gases on the calculation of gas compressibility (Z) factors. Laboratory measured gas compositions and Z factors are used to evaluate the accuracy of the Standing-Katz chart. It was determined that the chart itself provides satisfactory accuracy; however, Kay's molar average combination rules or comparable gravity relationships for calculating pseudo-critical pressure and temperature result in unsatisfactory Z factors for high molecular weight reservoir gases. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, new pseudo-critical property - gas gravity relationships are developed, and second, alternate methods for calculating pseudo-critical properties from composition are established. properties from composition are established. By utilizing either of these methods to calculate pseudo-critical pressure and temperature, pseudo-critical pressure and temperature, the overall accuracy of Z factors from the Standing-Katz chart is increased almost three-fold. Introduction High molecular weight hydrocarbon gases normally encountered in the petroleum industry can be grouped into two general categories. Natural gases in the first category contain relatively high concentrations of ethane and propane typically as the result of a low pressure flash with crude oil, while gases in the pressure flash with crude oil, while gases in the second category are gas-condensates and derive their high molecular weight from the quantity of heptanes-plus present. This paper is concerned with latter category present. This paper is concerned with latter category of gases. The calculation of natural gas volume, density, or viscosity at elevated pressures and temperatures requires values of Z factor. These quantities are necessary for the evaluation of gas reserves, the resulting pressure drop from flow through pipe, static pressure gradients in gas wells, and reservoir pressure gradients in gas wells, and reservoir performance. Ideally, gas PVT properties are performance. Ideally, gas PVT properties are determined from laboratory studies designed to duplicate conditions of interest. However, quite often experimental data is unavailable, or PVT properties must be evaluated at conditions different properties must be evaluated at conditions different from those examined by the laboratory studies. In these cases, PVT properties must be determined from correlations. Probably the most widely accepted correlation for natural gas mixtures is the Standing-Katz (SK) Z factor chart. The SK chart was developed using data for binary mixtures of methane with propane, ethane, butane, and natural gases having a wide range of composition. None of the gas mixtures had molecular weights in excess of 40. The SK chart is actually a modification and extension of a generalized, Z factor chart developed by Brown and Holcomb (BH) and is identical to the BH chart at reduced pressures less than 4. Above this value, the BH chart was found to be consistently inaccurate; therefore, Standing and Katz used data from 16 natural gas mixtures, along with methane Z factors as a guide, to extend the chart to reduced pressures of 15. Since the SK chart appeared in the literature in 1941, equations of state have been developed which effectively reproduce and extend the chart as shown by the Dranchuk and Abou-Kassem method in Figs. 1A and 1B. This chart correlates Z factor as a function of pseudo-reduced pressure and temperature: pressure and temperature: Z = f(Ppr, Tpr)...............................(1) where the pseudo-reduced pressure and temperature are defined relative to pseudo-critical pressure and temperature. Ppr = P/Ppc...................................(2) Tpr = T/Tpc...................................(3)}

  abstract	= {This work studies the effect of heptanes-plus (C7+) characterization on equation-of-state (EOS) predictions. Both the Peng-Robinson EOS (PREOS) and a modified Redlich-Kwong EOS are used. Several characterization schemes found in the literature are used in the study. Six reservoir fluids with extended C7+ analysis have been chosen, representing a broad range of compositions and PVT data.

First, the study deals with methods for estimating specific gravities and boiling points of petroleum fractions, two properties usually required by critical property correlations. EOS predictions are made by using critical properties based on specific gravities and boiling points measured experimentally and estimated with correlations.

Next, a review of critical-property correlations is given, including a review of commonly used correlations. Four correlations are chosen to study the effect of critical properties on EOS predictions. Results indicate that relatively small differences in critical properties and acentric factor can result in significant differences in EOS predictions.

Finally, a study is made of the effect that adjustments in C7+ critical properties have on EOS predictions; adjustments of EOS constants (Oa and Ob) and binary interaction coefficients also are studied. The influence of individual and combined adjustments to C7+ properties are illustrated graphically. They provide qualitative guidelines that can be used when matching experimental PVT data with an EOS.}
